# heart-disease-prediction - SC1015 lab mini-project

## About 
This is a mini project for SC1015 where we are analysing the factors that affect heart disease. Our code includes:
1. Checking Correlation (numerical variables)
2. Analysing Categorical Variables
3. Data visualisation
4. Prediction Models
5. Evaluating accuracy of models
6. Conclusion
## Contributors

## Problem Definition
- Which physiological factors of an individual are most important in predicting whether they have a high likelihood of having a heart disease?
- Which data prediction model is most suitable for this context?

## Models used
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours Classification
3. Random Forest Classification

## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?
no clue
