# Heart Disease Prediction - SC1015 lab mini-project

## About 
This is a mini project for SC1015 where we are analysing the factors that affect heart disease. Our code includes:
1. Checking Correlation (numerical variables)
2. Analysing Categorical Variables
3. Data visualisation
4. Prediction Models
5. Evaluating accuracy of models
6. Conclusion
## Contributors
- TiffanyEstralita - Numerical Variables, Data Visualisation, Evaluating Accuracy of Models
- joyfz20 - Analysis categorical variables, Prediction Models, Conclusion

## Problem Definition
- Which physiological factors of an individual are most important in predicting whether they have a high likelihood of having a heart disease?
- Which data prediction model is most suitable for this context?

## Models used
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours Classification
3. Random Forest Classification

## Conclusion
- The most important factors in predicting the presence of heart disease is thalach, oldpeak, slope, sex and exang

## What did we learn from this project?
- Attempted using new models like random forest and KNN
- Learnt about indicators like precision, recall, F1 score and support
- Collaborating on Github
